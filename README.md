# lmswithoutsql.java
Library Management System project with many classes included.The project can work but need database to connect each other to collect data from it. I used Eclipse IDE version 2019-12.





The best solution of the project is to upload in rar. Because this is finished working project  on eclipse ide. 

Another solution:  move all png and gif files to lms folder. Then, create a bin folder> move lms folder inside then go back. You will have bin and src folders. Create new folder then move all of them inside. Then run eclipse, import the folder then run  java folders. They are connected to each other.




Unzip  the folder than go to eclipse ide > file > import a project folder > select lms folder then  be sure u have installed windowbuilder  as well. Then you need to open the all java classes with window builder or you can see through the code. 





If you have no libraries that l have used  please check online to download patches on Eclipse IDE. 



Also you can try Netbeans







You will need database for this project to work properly!
