# lmswithoutsql.java
Library Management System project with many classes included.The project can work but need database to connect each other to collect data from it. I used Eclipse IDE version 2019-12.


the best solution of the project is to upload in rar. Because this is finished working project  on eclipse ide. 

Unzip  the folder than go to eclipse ide > file > import a project folder > select lms folder then  be sure u have installed windowbuilder  as well. Then you need to open the all java classes with window builder or you can see through the code. 

If you have no libraries that l have used  please check online to download patches on eclipse. 


You will need database for this project to work properly!
